# Inheritance-
Inheritance in object-oriented programming is a fundamental concept where one class (child or subclass) acquires properties and behaviors (fields and methods) from another class (parent or superclass). It enables code reusability and hierarchical classification. It's widely used in languages like Java, C++, and Python.
